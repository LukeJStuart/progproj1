	<h1>What is machine learning!</h1>
	<p>When we think of a program we usually think of a programmer, hunched over a bright screen spending hours upon hours of carefully formatted text. For decades programs have had their functionality and workings carefully dictated by a person, but due to recent development over the last decade or two this could be about to change. Machine Learning refers to the ability of a program to actively change itself in order to better solve a set of parameters. Neural networks are commonly refered to when talking about machine learning, these are computer programs that emulate the neuron layout of a brain, they have a set of parameters to optimize themselves to achieve based on a set of inputs. Convulutional neural networks as an exmaple break down an image into its finer components and then build up into coarse details, so it may start with look at individual angles of edges, then individual features like a nose or eyes, then larger features like a whole dog or a cat. Image recognition has long been a pitfall of computing but CNNs have allowed computers to become much more accurate when recgonizing objects.</p>
