Interest of content
Very good, the content was overall well done and goes into quite a few topics I had initially never even thought about I particularly 
enjoyed the music section of the page. I would have liked it more if the machine learning section of the site had been elaborated on further
but all in all, a great effort that shows each members' knowledge of their topics.

Consistency and quality of visual presentation
Sound, the visual presentation did not leave too much to be desired, the website design was clean and easy to read through but, the design 
of the menu is just a bit lackluster. On the other hand, there are quite a few problems with the consistency of the site, it seems that 
each page of the site has a different font and design. In particular, the page for the 'machine learning' is missing a link to the page for
'the elderly'. A good effort, but could definitely have been better.

Quality of written presentation
Very good, there was an interesting variation in vocabulary used creating a nice flow in the content. Each member's flair for writing really 
shines through and I personally couldn't find any significant grammar mistakes.

Validity of html
Good, as a whole, the website seems to work fine with the acception of a few small flaws. One of them being that, I am unable to view most 
images on the site, also, there is a noticeable mistake in the html on the 'Communication' page, in which some html code is clearly visible
on the actual page

Evidence of collaboration
Very good, I'm not really sure what to write here. But there is definitely some evidence of collaboration, and while it's not trumpeted 
around each page, I feel like it's an appropriate amount and does not distract from the actual content of the page.
