# My Review
-----------

## Interest of content
- Sound
The pages that do have some content are interesting, I really enjoyed reading about how computers have impacted elderly people and its role in the medical sector.
The homepage is not massively engaging, it has no text content whatsoever, just a slider of photos.

## Consistency and quality of visual presentation
- Weak
The pages are not visually consistent across the website. Every page has a different menu bar design, and the backgrounds are different colours on different pages.
It's also a bit difficult to navigate from page to page. Some pages are missing links in the menu bar. For example, you can't get to *The Elderly* page from the *Machine Learning* page.

## Quality of written presentation
- Good
There are a few typographical errors
There appears to be some strange text on some pages - *Communication* has  `<<<<<<< HEAD ` and `>>>>>>> fce73e9193c77c80538284bbf268c239450a6306` in the middle of the text content

## Validity of HTML
- Very good
There are 2 start html tags: `<html lang="en">` and `<html>` (as well as the doctype). There should be _one_ doctype and _one_ html tag.
Other than that, the HTML is pretty much valid.

## Evidence of collaboration
- Sound
The workload split is somewhat uneven, *ppkd93* didn't commit anything until an hour before this review; whereas *LukeJStuart* has clearly done a lot of work.  
The last commit was 3 minutes before I was reviewing it.
