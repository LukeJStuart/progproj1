i) Interest of Content\

\
Communication page has good text content, but could be improved using images, hyperlinks and some extra UI elements. Currently the only content on the page is HTML (excluding the nav bar). Machine learning page doesn\'92t have a nav bar, or any content (just author information). Medicine page is really good, uses images, hyperlinks and Bootstrap elements. However the nav bar is inconsistent with the rest of the website (would be nice if all web pages had the same one). The Elderly web page also has good content and is well designed, however it would benefit from some hyperlinks to provide additional information about each topic. \

ii) Consistency and quality of visual representation\

As previously mentioned, the Communication page and Machine learning page lack any bootstrap elements, images or hyperlinks. The nav bar is often inconsistent between web pages. The Elderly and Medicine pages both have good designs and use good bootstrap elements. \

iv) Validity of HTML\
\'97\'97\'97\'97\'97\'97\'97\'97\'97\'97\
\
The HTML for each web-page is valid and is generally easy to read.\
\
Rating: Excellent\
\
v) Evidence of Collaboration \
\'97\'97\'97\'97\'97\'97\'97\'97\'97\'97\'97\'97\'97\'97\
\
The Communication page is lacking Author information. The other pages including Music all have good author information. Machine learning is unfinished with only the author information available on the page. \
